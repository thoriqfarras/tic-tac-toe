## Reflection

This project is quite minimal as I was quite busy with college stuff at the time of creating it.

### ðŸ‘‘ Wins
- Managed to organize my code modularly using factory functions by following the ['building-a-house-from-the-inside-out'](https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out) method. I kinda copied the author's way of structuring things but adjusted it for this project and added some additional twinkles as well.
- Made the whole thing kinda responsive by just using one line (no media queries!).

### ðŸš§ Hurdles
- Implementing the highlight line feature took me quite a while. The solution in the end was simple though.

### ðŸ›„ Takeaway
- Factory functions lets you create private and public properties for an object.
- Leaving as little global variables as possible is a good thing as it minimizes the chance of the code being tampered with. On the other hand, it makes console testing harder.
